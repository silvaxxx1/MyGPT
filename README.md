# MyGPT üöÄ

**MyGPT** is a Large Language Model (LLM) implemented from scratch using PyTorch, featuring a custom tokenizer inspired by the OpenAI tokenizer. This project covers everything from building the tokenizer, pretraining the model, fine-tuning it for specific tasks, and creating applications on top of the LLM.

## Features üåü

- **Custom Tokenizer**: A tokenizer built from scratch, following the OpenAI tokenizer approach.
- **Pretraining**: Train your own GPT-like language model from scratch on large datasets.
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapt the model to specialized tasks and datasets.
- **Application Building**: Use the trained model to build applications like text generation, chatbots, or anything NLP-related.

## Project Structure üìÇ

- `tokenizer/`: Implementation of the custom tokenizer.
- `model/`: The core LLM implemented in PyTorch.
- `training/`: Scripts for pretraining the model from scratch.
- `finetuning/`: Fine-tuning scripts for adapting the model to specific tasks.
- `applications/`: Sample applications showcasing how to use the fine-tuned model.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyGPT.git
cd MyGPT
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have PyTorch and other dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Pretrain the Model
To start training from scratch, use the `pretraining` script:
```bash
python training/pretrain.py --config config/pretrain_config.json
```

### 4. Fine-tune the Model
Once pretraining is done, fine-tune the model for a specific task:
```bash
python finetuning/finetune.py --model-path path_to_pretrained_model
```

### 5. Run Applications
Check out the `applications/` folder for examples of what you can build with **MyGPT**.

## Roadmap üõ£Ô∏è

- [ ] Complete custom tokenizer implementation.
- [ ] Add larger-scale pretraining examples.
- [ ] Add more fine-tuning tasks (e.g., text classification, question answering).
- [ ] Build more demo applications.
